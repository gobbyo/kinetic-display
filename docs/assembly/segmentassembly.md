# Segment Assembly and Installation

The digit segments and colons give the display its distinctive design. Each hollow segment lights up when extended and turns off when retracted, creating a satisfying clacking sound with every movement. Like a traditional seven-segment display, the segments are tilted at a 5-degree angle for a sleek appearance.

## Assemble and Install Segments

This section guides you through assembling and installing all segments on the display. The image below shows the 3D-printed parts required for segment assembly.

1. **Insert the Rack Gear**. Slide the end of the rack gear with the smallest rectangular hole into the segment sleeve, as shown below.

1. **Secure the Rack Gear**. Use needlenose pliers to hold the segment pin. Insert the pin through the small rectangular hole in the segment sleeve and rack gear to secure it, as shown below.

1. **Install the Segment**. Place the segment into its designated location on the display. Ensure the segment slides easily into its bay. If it does not, ***do not force it into place***. Try a different location for the segment.

1. **Repeat for All Segments**. Follow the above steps to install all digit and colon segments.

## Assemble and Install the Rackgear Bumpers

1. **Attach the Gasket**. Push the rackgear bumper gasket into the square hole on the face of the rackgear bumper, as shown below.

2. **Position the Bumper**. Slide the front peg of the rackgear bumper into the rectangular hole on the rackgear ***opposite the pinion gear***. Installing it on the same side as the pinion gear will cause the actuator to jam when extended.
