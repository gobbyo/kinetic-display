## Assemble and Install Segments

In this section you'll assemble and install all the segments on the display. The picture below shows the 3D printed parts needed to assemble all the segments.

1. Slide the end of the rackgear having the smallest rectangular hole into the segment sleeve as shown in the picture below.
![segmentassembly-1](../img/segmentassembly/segmentassembly-1.webp)
1. Using needlenose pliers to hold the segment pin, secure the rack gear in place by sliding the segment pin through the small rectangular hole in the segment sleeve and rack gear as shown in the picture below.

1. Install the segment into the appropriate segment location on the display. Note the segment should easily slide all the way into its bay, if it does not slide easily into the bay, then ***do not force it into place***. Try a different location for the segment.

1. Repeat the previous steps until all the segments and colon segments are installed.

## Assemble and Install the Rackgear Bumpers

1. Push the rackgear bumper gasket into the square hole on the face of the rackgear bumper as shown in the picture below.

1. Slide the front peg of the rackgear bumper all the way forward into the rectangular hole on the rackgear ***opposite the pinion gear*** as shown in the picture below. Note the actuator will jam when extended if the rackgear is installed on the same side as the pinion gear.

1. Gently push the tail end of the rackgear bumper into the rectangular hole with needlenose pliers as shown in the picture below.
