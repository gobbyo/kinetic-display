# Power Management PCB Assembly

There are several choices of power supplies available in the market. Why not simply use a retail 5v power supply? A few important reasons for building a custom power management system for the display include:

- **Stable Voltage**: A drop in voltage occurs in a poor power supply when the heavy duty 103 electric toy motor starts up because each motor requires a high inrush of current to extend or retract the display's segments. Most retail power supplies cannot provide sufficient current causing a dramatic voltage drop leading to instability. The power supply setup in this section ensures the components receive a consistent 5V power, preventing malfunctions or damage to the more sensitive electronic components like the microcontrollers and sensors.
- **Current Requirements**: The display has colons, with two motors; four digits, each with seven independent electric motors. There can be up to 5 electric motors running simultaneously to extend or contract the segment or colon. Note there are also additional power requirements for lighting the LEDs. The power system you'll build in this section provides sufficient current to power all motors, sensors, and controllers simultaneously.
- **Safety**: Protects the system from overvoltage, short circuits, or power surges.
- **Customization**: Tailors the power supply to meet the specific needs of the kinetic display's design and components.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces energy loss and improves the overall performance of the display. An old school coil-driven relay is used to shut off power to the digits when in low power mode and not displaying anything. There are other ways to accomplish the same thing with solid state relays or a FET. However, the display is kinetic by design and the use of a coil relay enhances its sound, feel, and aesthetics.
