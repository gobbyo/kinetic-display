## Digit PCBs

The display has 4 digits. The digits are numbered from right to left, 0-3, when looking at the front of display. The digit PCBs are digits 0, 2, and 3 whereas the controller PCB is digit 1 and includes the colons. This section details the building of digits 0, 2, and 3.

Components needed for this section.

1. From the front facing side of the PCB, insert the 16 pin header into the through holes by aligning the notch with the PCB top silk layer outline of the 16 pins. The notch in the 16-pin header is used to ensure correct orientation when connecting the L293D motor driver. Carefully turn over the PCB while keeping the 16 pin header in the through holes.
