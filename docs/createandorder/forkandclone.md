# Fork and clone GitHub

For this task you will create a fork of the kinetic display repository and clone the fork locally onto your workstation. You will need to work with a code fork so that you can modify your local files without changing the original source code. Note the bias of this documentation is to use the Windows operating system with the latest Git tools.

From your windows machine, install the Git tool set:

1. Open a browser session and click the link to [Get started with GitHub documentation - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
1. Click on the link [Creating an account on GitHub - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) to create your account
1. Then [Set up Git - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) to install the Git tool set.  Use the default values in the setup wizard
1. Login with your GitHub account credentials
1. From your browser open [kinetic-display](https://github.com/gobbyo/kinetic-display)
1. Click on the "Fork" dropdown and create a new fork
1. Open a command prompt and make a new directory/folder by typing ```mkdir repos``` and hit the enter key
1. Change your command prompt to the new directory using command ```cd repos```
1. From your browser, copy the command HTTPS Clone URL and paste it into your command window then hit the enter key. You should see a fork of all the files from the kinetic-display appear in a new folder at ```.\repos\kinetic-display\```.

Congratulations, you have the files to begin your project!
