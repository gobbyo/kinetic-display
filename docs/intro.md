## Introduction

The Kinetic display is a unique and entertaining way to view the current time, date, indoor temperature and humidity, and outdoor temperature and humidity, see the feature summary short clip video below. The robotic device is a seven-segment clock-like display with 4 digits and 2 colons, totalling 30 actuators that extend and retract the segments. Each segment lights up when extended then turns off when retracted. A clacking sound is made each time the actuator extends or retracts the segment, making satisfying percussive sound tapistry while in operation.
