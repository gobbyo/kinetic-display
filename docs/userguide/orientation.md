Following the diagram below.

- **A** is Digit 0
- **B** is Digit 1
- **C** is Upper and lower colons
- **D** is Digit 2
- **E** is Digit 3

Each digit has seven segments A-G that extend or retract depending on the action.

When a segment extends, LEDs behind the segment provide lighting to give it a uniform glow. A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) above Digit 1 in the back, senses the ambient light in the room causing the LEDs to dim or brighten. All extended segments with lit LEDs adjust to the given light level. The LEDs turn off when the segment retracts.

The display has several actions allowing you to customize a scheduler which determines when and which item among the following is displayed:

1. **Local time** in 12 or 12 hour, both colons extended
2. **Date** in month and day, both colons retracted
3. **Internal temperature** in Celsius or Fahrenheit, upper colon extended, lower colon retracted
4. **Internal humidity** in percent, upper colon extended, lower colon retracted
5. **External temperature** in Celsius or Fahrenheit, lower colon extended, upper colon retracted
6. **External humidity** in percent, lower colon extended, upper colon retracted

The display also allows you to show the digits as human or alien, see the [translation table for alien digits](../userguide/digittype.md)
