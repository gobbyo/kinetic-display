The diagrams below identify the various parts and composition of the actuator. Fully assembled actuator with segment and back stopper. Actuator rack and pinion gear assembly. The actuator assembly includes installing the shaft gear onto the DC brushed motor, preparing and adding the wires to the motor, assembling the motor mount, pinion gear and shaft, then adding the DC brushed motor to the assembled motor mount. Shaft Gear In this section you'll glue the shaft gear onto the shaft to avoid slippage. The shaft gear must be made from rigid filament like PLA or ABS. Shaft Gear Installation Steps The tools and parts needed to install the shaft gear include: a regular tipped screwdriver, super glue, motor shaft 10-toothed gear, and DC brushed toy motor. Add a drop of super glue to attach the shaft gear. Note the shaft gear is 10mm high and the hole is 5mm. Position the DC toy motor vertically so the bottom of the DC motor shaft sits on a hard surface. Use the regular tipped screwdriver to press the 10-toothed gear onto the shaft. Be sure to push the 10-toothed gear 5mm down into the shaft. Repeat the steps in this section for the remaining 29 motors. Wires After the actuator is assembled, it will be connected to the digit PCB. The white 28 AWG wire provides the clockwise (CW) motion that extends the segment, the black wire provides the counter clockwise (CCW) motion that retracts the segment. Wire Cutting and Soldering Steps In this section you'll create 21 unlabelled motors with 4 centimeter wires with Dupont connectors, 4 motors labelled \"C\", 4 motors labelled \"D\", and one labelled \"UC\" (upper colon), totalling 9 motors having 6 centimeter wires with dupont connectors. The tools and parts needed to prepare and add the wires to the DC motor includes: black and white 28 AWG stranded wire, wire strippers for 28 AWG wire, and a soldering station with 0.8mm 1.76g flux core solder. Cut 9 white and 9 black wires of 6 centimeter lengths for segment actuators C and D and the upper colon. Cut 21 white and 21 black wires of 4 centimeter lengths for the remaining actuators. Strip about 3mm off one end of each black and white wire. Position the DC motor so the shaft is facing upward and the terminals are on the top. Set your soldering iron to 350\u00b0C then add solder to each motor terminal. Solder the white wire onto the left motor terminal and the black wire onto the right motor terminal. Be sure to label the motors with 6 centimeter wire as C, D, and the upper colon. Dupont Connections The tools and parts needed to add the 2.54mm Dupont connectors to each wire include: the DC motor with shaft gear and wires (as prepared in the previous steps), a Dupont connector crimping tool, 60 female Dupont pin connectors and 30 1x2p Dupont connector housings. Strip 3mm off the end of the DC motor wire. Crimp the female connectors onto each wire. Attach the Dupont connector housing onto the wires so the pins lock into the housing. Repeat the previous steps for all remaining motors. Be sure to place your label on the black side of the motor for the nine, 6 centimeter wire length actuators with C, D or UC (upper colon). No need to label the 21 other actuators with 4 centimeter lengths Motor Mount The tools and parts needed to assemble the motor mount include: 3d printed motor mount in PLA and Nylon pinion reduction gear, a 20mm metal shaft made from a jumbo paper clip, a soldering station capable of a heat setting of 250\u00b0 C, clamping tweezers with a thin piece of metal. Verify the shaft can easily slide through the pinion gear before assembling the motor. If you cannot easily rotate the pinion gear on the shaft, then you'll need a 1/16\" drill bit and drill to widen the pinion gear shaft hole. Cut the off the straight sections from the Jumbo paper clip. Measure 2 cm from each Jumbo paper clip straight section. Use a large wire cutter to cut the shaft. With a 1/16\" drill bit, bore out the shaft hole in the pinion gear. Insert the 2 cm shaft about 1 millimeter into the motor mount. Add the pinion gear to the motor mount as shown in the diagram. Insert the shaft by aligning the pinion gear shaft hole with the metal shaft, then slide the metal shaft all the way into the motor mount. Heat your soldering iron to 250\u00b0C and prepare your clamping tweezer and zinc strip as shown in the picture. Hold the zinc strip over the shaft collar and press down on the zinc strip with your soldering iron. Melt the collar and flatten it onto the motor mount. When finished, the melted collar will only protrude about a half millimeter out from the motor mount. Hold the main body of the motor mount so the pinion gear faces left. Avoid touching or putting any pressure onto the motor mounting tabs used the screw the motor onto the display. With your other hand, hold the prepared motor with the shaft pointed left and the terminals downward, insert the prepared motor into the motor mount. Repeat the process for the remaining 29 motors.

Add the label to the FRONT FACING SIDE of each of the 3 digit PCBs as placed in the picture below. Also note that digit 0 is a completed digit PCB ready for mounting onto the display. Add the label to the BACK FACING SIDE of each of the 3 digit PCBs as placed in the picture below. Add the 16 pin headers From the front side of the digit PCB, insert the 16 pin header into the through holes by aligning the notch with the digit PCB top silk layer outline of the 16 pins. The notch in the 16-pin header is used to ensure correct orientation when connecting the L293D motor driver. Carefully turn over the digit PCB while keeping the 16 pin header in the through holes. Solder the 16 pins and repeat the previous step until all 4 of the 16 pin headers are soldered into place. From the back of the digit PCB, cut off the soldered pins. Touch up the clipped pins with a small bit of solder to make smooth rounded beads instead of sharp points. Clean up the soldered pins by removing the flux using a cotton pad dabbed with isopropyl alcohol. Repeat the previous step if you find your cotton pad is being torn from any protruding pins. Add the 28 LEDs BEFORE SOLDERING LEDS ONTO YOUR DIGIT PCB, be sure to test your LEDs on a breadboard and use a digital camera to spot any variations in color when the LEDs are lit. Below is a photo showing the color variation of blue 5mm LEDs within the same batch using a breadboards power rail with 2.63v. There are seven segments \"A\" through \"G\" each with four LEDs. From the front of the digit PCB, start with segment A by inserting the LED's long lead (anode) into the \"+\" through hole. Repeat the process for all segment-A LEDs. Carefully turn over the digit PCB and rest it with the back facing up. Solder each of the LED leads onto the digit PCB. Snip off the excess from the LED leads. Resolder all LEDs into place by repeating the previous step Clean the flux off with a cotton pad dabbed in isopropyl alcohol. Repeat the previous steps for segments B through G until all 28 LEDs are soldered onto the PCB. Add the Motor Pins The tools and components needed for this section includes 14, 2.54 mm male breakaway pins, needle nose pliers, soldering station and solder. Break out 7 pairs of motor pins using needle nose pliers. On the back of the digit PCB, place the short end of the pin-pair into each actuator segment through hole (seg-A through seg-G). On the front of the digit PCB, solder the reminder of the pins Continuing on the front of the digit PCB, cut the pins flush on the pcb. Resolder the snipped pins to create smooth beads. Clean off the flux residue using a cotton pad dabbed in isopropyl alcohol. Mount the L293D 16-pin IC Stepper Motor Drivers From the front of the digit PCB, orient the motor driver so the notch (or pin 1) is aligned with the 16 pin header.

First print all the white pieces, then black. The display face uses over 2/3rds of the 1 KG roll of filament. Therefore, be sure to use the same roll of filament when printing both halves of the display face, segments, and colons. Also, have two 1 KG rolls of white filament from the same batch to avoid inconsistencies in your print color. Do not use any glue as it is not necessary and may make a mess. Do not worry if your 3D printer and slicer cannot iron the top surfaces. Ironing the top surfaces is for fit and finish and will not affect the functionality of the display. Be sure you apply an adhesive to the printer plate bed otherwise the edges and corners of the display face may warp. I used all weather Aqua Net, super hold hair spray for my display faces which provided an even coating of adhesive across the entire surface of the bed plate and resulted in clean corners and edges.
